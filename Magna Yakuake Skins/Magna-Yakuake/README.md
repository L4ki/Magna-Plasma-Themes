# yakuake-magna-skin

A clean, modern Yakuake skin based on the Magna Dark KDE theme. If you use Yakuake with the Magna theme, this skin will make it much more consistent with the rest of your system.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Kolgann/yakuake-magna-skin/releases)
2. Open Yakuake and go to `Configure Yakuake...`
3. Navigate to the `Appearance` tab.
4. Click on `Install Skin...` and select the downloaded archive.
5. Choose `Magna` from the list of skins and apply it.
6. Yakuake's default settings for the tab bar do not respect skin transparency, which causes the skin to not display correctly. Recommended to check the box for `Use skin transparency if supported` and set the `Background color opacity` to `0%`. (Or just disable `Show the tab bar` under the `Window` settings if you don't use it.)

## Compatibility

- Yakuake 3.0 and above
- KDE Plasma 5.18 and above
